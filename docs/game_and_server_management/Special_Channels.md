# Special Channels

Part of the Magic Toolbox of Game Distribution includes two new special channel types: store channels and news channels. Store channels let you show off your hand-crafted store pages in your server; news channels let you publish beautiful news embeds directly to the Activity Feeds of Discord users who play your game. Let's learn how to use them!

## Store Channels

One of the new flagship features of Verified Servers and Game Servers are the ability to host your store pages directly in your server. We know that community is everything for games, and that your server is already the place where your community lives. Rather than the friction and impersonality of traditional storefronts, you can let your fans find your game in the cozy comfort of their home (your server!).

In order to create a store channel for your game, you'll need to make sure you've followed [the Walkthrough](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_HOW_TO_GET_YOUR_GAME_ON_DISCORD/) up to `Getting Approved`. If you've done that, you'll see in your server that you can create a new channel type: `Store`.

Along with entering a name for your new channel, you'll be prompted to select an application. This should be the app you created when you started; it's the one linked to your server. After selecting your app, you'll be prompted to select a SKU. What's a SKU? A SKU is simply a thing that a user can buy. This is most likely your game (a SKU of type `Game`), but could also be `IAP`, `DLC`, or a `Bundle`.

You can create SKUs to put up for sale by going to your app and selecting `SKU Management`.

Once you select your SKU and create your channel...it's there! You now have a store channel in your server! If you want, you can set permissions on this channel like any channel in a server to restrict who can see it. Learn more about that by reading [Alpha and Beta Testing](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_ALPHA_AND_BETA_TESTING/).

## News Channels

> warn
> News channels are currently in beta and are subject to change.

The Activity Feed is the home page of Discord - where millions of users go to get news about their favorite games, see what their friends are playing, and jump into action with our universal launcher.

As part of our ongoing effort to help you build your game community, we've now added the ability for you to publish news from your server directly to the Activity Feed. **This means that your content updates and patch notes can now reach all users on Discord who play your game, not just the users who are in your server!**

This is currently a beta feature and is subject to change based on user feedback and testing.

### Guidelines

With great power, come great responsibility - therefore, we've got some guidelines for you to follow:

- PC-only news and updates are preferred (unless your game is console or mobile-only).
- Content must be directly relevant to the game (no cross promotion of other games unless its in the same franchise).
- No excessively sexual or violent content.
- No content that is purely an advertisement, please. This is not the place for it.

All content must also abide by our [Community Guidelines](https://discordapp.com/guidelines).

### How to Enable News Channels

In order to create a news channel for your game, you'll need to make sure you've followed [the Walkthrough](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_HOW_TO_GET_YOUR_GAME_ON_DISCORD/) up to `Getting Approved`. If you already have a text channel in which you post game announcements, you can turn it into a news channel by doing the following:

1. Hover over the channel name and click on the settings cog icon to go into Channel Settings.
2. Set channel as News Channel.

Otherwise:

1. In the channel list, hover over the channel category where you want your News channel to live and hit the + icon to Create a Channel.
2. Select News as the channel type, and enter a channel name.
3. Click Create Channel.

Tada! Anytime you post an announcement with a link, you can now hover over the message, click the menu icon (the three dots on the right), and click "Post to Activity" to publish the news to the Activity Feeds of all users who play your game. Make sure to set permissions properly so that only people who properly represent your game can send messages in that channel. All users who have permission to send messages in the channel will be able to publish news to the Activity Feed.

You can now publish all the exciting updates about your game directly to the Activity Feed of your players!

## Special Channels and Lurker Mode

These two types of special Discord channels have another special property that we call `lurkability`. "Lurker Mode" is a feature that we've been experimenting with throughout Discord; it allows users to read public channels in a server without _actually_ joining the server. It also allows users to look at these channels without being logged in to Discord.

> info
> Users viewing channels in Lurker Mode will not be able to send messages in those channels. They'll be prompted to log in and join the server if they want to chat.

Lurker Mode is automatically enabled for news and store channels in your server. When someone accepts a server invite that links to a news or store channel, they'll be viewing in "Lurker Mode".

We know that your server and community are at the heart of your game's success on Discord. Having Discord users see your news and store pages in the context of your server will help drive more members to your community and help you grow that awesome fanbase for your game.
